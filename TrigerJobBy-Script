First go to jenkins-server su - as a root
open vim /etc/hosts add line 127.0.0.1 hostname
e.g. 127.0.0.1 ubu
then
 go to configure system where jenkins-url in format
http://ip-address:8080/ e.g http://192.168.1.2:8080/
make/pu there hostname eg. ubu then
jenkins-url http://ubu:8080/
and save
then write script vim crumb.sh
crumb=$(curl -u "admin:redhat" -s 'http://ubu:8080/crumbIssuer/api/xml?xpath=concat(//crumbRequestField,":",//crumb)')
curl -u "admin:redhat" -H "$crumb" -X POST http://ubu:8080/job/my-first-job1/build?delay=0sec
##http://ubu:8080/job/my-first-job1/build?delay=0sec this link you get from Build now right-click copy link address
   the build you want to run from outside by bash script
   
then chmod +x crumb.sh you get error HTTP ERROR 403 No valid crumb was included in the request

solution:- go to jenkins dashboard manage plugins available search strict crumb issues and downlaod and install it
then
 after restart jenkins dashboard go to manage jenkins--> 
 configur global security in that crumb issuer select strict crumb issuer
 then uncheck box of Check Session ID
 
 and save
 and now if you do sh crumb.sh on server and check jenkins dashboard new build will generate automatically
 as much as times you run sh crumb.sh the builds are generates
